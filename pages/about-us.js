          <h1> About Us </h1>
          <p>
            We&#39;re a group of sophomore, computer science majors from ACIT in
            New Jersey hoping to express a little bit of creativity and
            development with Spie.

            Spie is a lyrics pie chart app that arranges the lyrics of Spotify
            songs into a pie chart. At first, Spie was among a list of other
            concepts and ideas our group had scrapped, but after careful
            consideration and a light of interest, Spie became something much
            more. Together we created a simple but interesting project that uses
            the Spotify API to grab user data and tracks their most played
            songs, producing a pie chart that ultimately rounds out how many
            times a word is used in the song.
